# Project code üë®‚Äçüíª

This project has been developed with **NuxtJS**. My main experience in a framework is with Vue, that's why I decided to use NuxtJS (an open framework based on Vue inspired by NextJS). Also, I think that for an application that would be used by any user and would be public to the internet, SSR applications are better for SEO since it makes it easier for Google's robot to read.

**Vuex**

I like use a Flux architecture.

**Middleware**

Middleware allows you to define custom functions that can be executed before a page or group of pages (layout) is displayed. I created one to check if the user is visiting the site from a mobile device, and if so show a different layout.

**Local Storage**

To save the theme, currency and favorites data I use localStorage. Maybe I could have used indexDB since it is a better optimized browser database than localStorage (Web Storage) but since the data are few and it is less complex, I decided to store it here.
